# ShapeGen3D
ShapeGen3D is a project that uses UNET and CLIP to generate 3D shapes like circles, squares, and triangles from textual descriptions. This repository includes the necessary code, models, and documentation to create and visualize these shapes using deep learning techniques.

Features

UNET Model: Utilizes a UNET architecture for precise shape generation.\n
CLIP Integration: Enhances shape generation by leveraging CLIP's powerful text-image embeddings to generate shapes from textual descriptions.
3D Shape Outputs: Generates 3D representations of basic geometric shapes like circles, squares, and triangles based on provided text inputs.
Easy to Use: Comprehensive documentation and examples to get you started quickly.
